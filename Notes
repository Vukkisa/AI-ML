Modules in Matplotlib

Matplotlib has several submodules, each designed for specific types of plotting and functionality. Some of the main and commonly used submodules include:

pyplot: The most widely used submodule for creating 2D plots and charts using a MATLAB-like interface (e.g., line plots, scatter plots, bar charts, histograms).

axes: Contains classes for creating and managing plot axes and coordinate systems.

figure: Deals with figure-level operations such as creating and manipulating figure windows.

artist: Contains the base classes for all objects that can be rendered on the figure, such as lines, text, shapes.

colors: Provides functions and classes for color conversion and handling colormaps.

font_manager: Manages fonts used in plots.

ticker: Controls the placement and formatting of ticks on axes.

patches: Contains shapes like rectangles, circles, polygons that can be added to plots.

gridspec: Enables complex subplot grid layouts.

animation: Supports creating animations from plots.

image: Functionality for displaying images.

text: Support for adding and manipulating text in plots.

contour: For contour and filled contour plots.



Random_state : split  dataset same each time when data gets splitted
